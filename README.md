> A mnemonic is any learning technique that aids information retention in the human memory. Mnemonics make use of elaborative encoding, retrieval cues, and imagery as specific tools to encode any given information in a way that allows for efficient storage and retrieval. Mnemonics aid original information in becoming associated with something more meaningful; - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic).

I usually forget the keybinds, It never made sense for me, somethings you need press `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, sometimes you need combine those keys, It's too hard to remember everything. After trying [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/), I decide to create my own mnemonic keybindings for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

## How to use it
Mnemonic Key Bindings is not a plugin, it's `cson` file, you should customize it as your own taste and save on your `keymap.cson` file(`ctrl+shift+p`: Open Your Keymap).
Feedbacks are welcome.
1) Update your `keymap.cson` with [my own version](https://github.com/mateuspv/atom-mnemonic-keybindings/blob/master/keymap.cson)
2) Update your `init.coffee` with [this file](https://github.com/mateuspv/atom-mnemonic-keybindings/blob/master/init.coffee)
3) Customize, change and send me feedback! :D
